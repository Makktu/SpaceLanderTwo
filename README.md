# SpaceLanderTwo

### (a working title)

The project is reborn.

##### 2 June 2023

* New movement system – 'Asteroids'-style.
* Vastly simplified & more organised codebase to reduce the mounting complexity of both the original and the first Prototype effort(s) of this follow-up.
* The environments remain the sticking point.
  * Massive sprites?
  * Tilemaps?
  * Vector-style line drawings?
  * A mix of some or all of the above?

Roadmap:
    Decide on the environments and start designing gameplay.

For now this is a testing ground for systems only.

Added another idea for the environment backgrounds, made in Aseprite.##### 3 June 2023

Leaped ahead with much progress over the past few days.
* Finally settled on an environment for the game (at least this level of it) to take place in.
* Added some more music tracks to set the mood (vintage neon-drenched, synth-coated sci-fi).
* Adjusted control variables.
* Added touchscreen controls -- a bit janky for now and might need a complete rethink for mobile.


Idea for next time –

- the space mines not to emerge from 'launchers'
- to hang from the walls or just hang in space
- activated by proximity
- will go motionless after 200 seconds or so and wait there for the player to pass by again!

This project is still very much a live one that is worked on almost every day – it's just taking a long time and I rarely update this README.

Right now, 2 things are causing a substantial bottleneck in progress:

The need to rework almost all of the core mechanics and add new features like the ability to shoot (Asteroids-style).
The spaghettification of the existing code means that, for example, reworking the pickup system has taken the best part of a week.

SpaceLander2D is not dead. It's just going through some issues.

##### 28 November 2023

Been very busy with other things in life and coding, so this project has had to take a back seat. It IS still very much alive, though.

Pickups for weapons and speed boosts have to be refined. Currently very scruffy. And how they impact on game flow has to be refined as well.
